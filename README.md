# Digit Recognizer

![Preview](https://github.com/catab60/Digit-Recognizer/blob/main/Preview.gif)

I created this Digit Recognizer project as a way to learn about machine learning and gain practical experience in neural networks. main.py is the GUI to test digit recognition. ModelTrainer.ipynb contains all the training steps for the neural network and how it works.

I finished the Digit Recognizer project in two days, spending time on research and coding the whole project by myself. Through the process, I learned a lot about the foundation of machine learning and understood the process much better. It was a great and exciting start to my machine learning journey, and I feel more confident now to apply what I learned to future projects.

## Installation:
1. Install the required libraries by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the GUI by executing `main.py`:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
